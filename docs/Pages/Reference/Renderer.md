# Renderer

Do you need to draw something? Well, you're probably in the right place!
This static class includes a variety of different drawing methods, from rendering
Models and Meshes, to setting rendering options and drawing to offscreen surfaces!
Even better, it's entirely a static class, so you can call it from anywhere :)
