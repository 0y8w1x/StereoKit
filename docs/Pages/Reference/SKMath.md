# SKMath

This class contains some convenience math functions! StereoKit
typically uses floats instead of doubles, so you won't need to cast to
and from using these methods.


## Fields and Properties

|  |  |
|--|--|
|float [Pi]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/SKMath/Pi.html)|The mathematical constant, Pi!|
|float [Tau]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/SKMath/Tau.html)|Tau is 2*Pi, there are excellent arguments that Tau can make certain formulas more readable!|



## Methods

|  |  |
|--|--|
|[Cos]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/SKMath/Cos.html)|Same as Math.Cos|
|[Sin]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/SKMath/Sin.html)|Same as Math.Sin|
|[Sqrt]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/SKMath/Sqrt.html)|Same as Math.Sqrt|
