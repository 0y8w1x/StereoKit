# Text

A collection of functions for rendering and working with text.



## Methods

|  |  |
|--|--|
|[Add]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Text/Add.html)|Renders text at the given location! Must be called every frame you want this text to be visible.|
|[MakeStyle]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Text/MakeStyle.html)|Create a text style for use with other text functions! A text style is a font plus size/color/material parameters, and are used to keep text looking more consistent through the application by encouraging devs to re-use styles throughout the project.|
|[Size]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Text/Size.html)|Sometimes you just need to know how much room some text takes up! This finds the size of the text in meters, when using the indicated style!|
