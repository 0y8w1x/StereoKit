|[Vec3]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Vec3.html) [direction]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Ray/direction.html)|The direction the ray is facing, typically does not require being a unit vector, or normalized direction.|
|[Vec3]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Vec3.html) [position]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Ray/position.html)|The position or origin point of the Ray.|



## Methods

|  |  |
|--|--|
|[Ray]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Ray/Ray.html)|Basic initialization constructor! Just copies the parameters into the fields.|
