|  |  |
|--|--|
|[Display]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Display.html) [Additive]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Display/Additive.html)|This display is transparent, and adds light on top of the real world. This is equivalent to a HoloLens type of device.|
|[Display]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Display.html) [AnyTransparent]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Display/AnyTransparent.html)|This matches either transparent display type! Additive or Blend. For use when you just want to see the world behind your application.|
|[Display]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Display.html) [Blend]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Display/Blend.html)|This is a physically opaque display, but with a camera passthrough displaying the world behind it anyhow. This would be like a Varjo XR-1, or phone-camera based AR.|
|[Display]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Display.html) [None]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Display/None.html)|Default value, when using this as a search type, it will fall back to default behavior which defers to platform preference.|
|[Display]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Display.html) [Opaque]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Display/Opaque.html)|This display is opaque, with no view into the real world! This is equivalent to a VR headset, or a PC screen.|
