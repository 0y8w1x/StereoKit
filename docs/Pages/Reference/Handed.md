An enum for indicating which hand to use!


## Fields and Properties

|  |  |
|--|--|
|[Handed]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Handed.html) [Left]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Handed/Left.html)|Left hand.|
|[Handed]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Handed.html) [Max]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Handed/Max.html)|The number of hands one generally has, this is much nicer than doing a for loop with '2' as the condition! It's much clearer when you can loop Hand.Max times instead.|
|[Handed]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Handed.html) [Right]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/Handed/Right.html)|Right hand.|
