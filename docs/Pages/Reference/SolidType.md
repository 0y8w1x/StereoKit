This describes the behavior of a 'Solid' physics object! the physics
engine will apply forces differently

|[SolidType]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/SolidType.html) [Immovable]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/SolidType/Immovable.html)|Immovable objects are always stationary! They have infinite mass, zero velocity, and can't collide with Immovable of Unaffected types.|
|[SolidType]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/SolidType.html) [Normal]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/SolidType/Normal.html)|This object behaves like a normal physical object, it'll fall, get pushed around, and generally be succeptible to physical forces! This is a 'Dynamic' body in physics simulation terms.|
|[SolidType]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/SolidType.html) [Unaffected]({{site.url}}/Pages/Reference/SolidType/Unaffected.html)|Unaffected objects have infinite mass, but can have a velocity! They'll move under their own forces, but nothing in the simulation will affect them. They don't collide with Immovable or Unaffected types.|
