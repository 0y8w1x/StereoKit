# Example Code!

This folder contains samples for a number of different programming languages and platforms, as well as assets shared between a number of them. C# developers will be most interested in [StereoKitTest](StereoKitTest/), and perhaps more specifically [StereoKitTest/Demos](StereoKitTest/Demos/)!

Developers adding features to StereoKit, or working directly with StereoKit's C API may find [StereoKitCTest](StereoKitCTest/) quite helpful, if not quite as fully featured as its C# counterpart.

Also included are some _very_ simple examples of using StereoKit from other languages, like [Zig](StereoKitZig/) and [V](StereoKitV/). These are more proof of concept, rather than robust samples, but may get the adventurous developer off the ground.

Note that most (not Zig/V) of these samples are meant to be deployed as a subset of the Visual Studio .sln in the root directory. For information about building these, see the [building guide](/BUILDING.md)
